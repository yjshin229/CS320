# BU CS320

## Ocaml Interpreter

Final project for my Concepts of Programming Languages class at BU (CS 320 - Fall 2021), I wrote an interpreter in OCaml.

## How To Run The Program 

### For part1 & part2

Download the part1(1).ml and install Ocaml from https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html. For MACOS or Linux users, ocaml can be installed through homebrew as well.

Test cases for part1(1).ml are in the src file.
The output for each test cases are in the res file. The format of the result will be (output, log). i.e)("Error", []), (int,[]), ((),[]). Elements in [] are the remaining elements in the stack.
