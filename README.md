# BU CS320

## Ocaml Interpreter

Final project for my Concepts of Programming Languages class at BU (CS 320 - Fall 2021), I wrote an interpreter in OCaml.

## How To Run The Program 

### part1 & part2

Download the part1(1).ml and install Ocaml from https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html. For MACOS or Linux users, ocaml can be installed through homebrew as well.

Test cases for part1(1).ml are in the src file. <br />
The output for each test cases are in the res file. The format of the result will be (output, log). i.e)("Error", []), (int,[]), ((),[]). Elements in [] are the remaining elements in the stack. 

### part3

The goal for part3 was to develop a compiler. It compiles a high level functional language to the stack language of part1&2.

Download the part3.ml file.

Test cases for part3.ml are in the out file. <br />
The outputs should be corresponding to the src file test cases.
